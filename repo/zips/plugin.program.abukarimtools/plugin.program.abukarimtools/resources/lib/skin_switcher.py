"""
Skin Switcher – switch between installed skins.
Adapted from script.skinswitcher.

Behaviour: pick a skin from the list, the switcher closes, the chosen skin
applies with no visible prompts. Kodi's own "Keep this change?" revert dialog
is what causes the flicker/loop; we avoid it by confirming any add-on-enable
prompt ourselves and dismissing the revert dialog immediately if it appears.
