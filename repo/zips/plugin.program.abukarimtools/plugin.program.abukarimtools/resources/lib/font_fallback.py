font_fallback.py - make Arabic readable in EVERY skin, including plugin
directory listings this add-on cannot otherwise control.

The problem
-----------
The ABUKARIM TOOLS main menu and the ABUKARIM wizard menu are ordinary Kodi
plugin directory listings (xbmcgui.ListItem + addDirectoryItem). Their font is
chosen entirely by the ACTIVE SKIN, not by us - an add-on has no way to set a
font on a directory listing. When the active skin's font has no Arabic glyphs
(or during a fresh install before the skin's Arabic fonts are in place), Kodi
substitutes its GLOBAL FALLBACK font, which is a glyph-less arial.ttf, and every
Arabic label renders as tofu (the empty boxes seen on first install).

The fix
-------
Kodi's global fallback lives at special://home/media/fonts/arial.ttf (i.e.
.kodi/media/fonts/arial.ttf). It is what EVERY skin drops to when its own font
lacks a glyph. If that file is Arabic-capable, the tofu disappears everywhere at
once - both our menus, the wizard's menus, and any other skin surface - with no
per-skin work and nothing that a skin update can wipe.

We already ship an Arabic-capable TTF (resources/fonts/Noto-Regular.ttf, verified
to cover every Arabic character used in both add-ons' strings), so we simply copy
it into the fallback location on boot. Kodi loads media/fonts/arial.ttf once at
start, so a freshly written file takes effect on the NEXT Kodi start; we compare
by size first so we only write when it actually differs (no needless churn, and
the "changed -> a restart will apply it" signal is meaningful).

This is best-effort and fully fenced: it must never raise into the caller
(service boot chores must still reach the first-run trigger).
