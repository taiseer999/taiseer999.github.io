# Nimbus Skin for Kodi Omega

Kodi File Manager Source: [https://ivarbrandt.github.io/repository.ivarbrandt/](https://ivarbrandt.github.io/repository.ivarbrandt/)

If you encounter any issues while using Nimbus, please follow these guidelines before opening an Issue:

- Read the **CHANGELOG**. As new updates get released features are added, changed, modified or removed. *Before opening an Issue* related to this make sure you read the changelog (located at the bottom of Skin settings in Extras) as it will contain information for all the changes made to each update. It is also a good way to stay current with what is new with the skin.
- Error related Issues **MUST** include a log file. Your Issue will be closed immediately if you fail to include a log file.
- Make sure to check all open Issues to see if your problem is being addressed already.
- Only **one** issue/feature request per user at a time. If I see multiple issues opened by the same user, all but the first issue they opened will be closed.
- **DO NOT** hijack an open Issue with unrelated problems. Open a new Issue.
- Do your best to **monitor** the Issue you have opened. If I need additional information and it is not supplied within 7 days, I will close the Issue.
