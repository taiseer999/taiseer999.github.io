window_rescue.py - bring Kodi back when a skin reload leaves no window open.

3.2.13: updating the ACTIVE skin (seen with Arctic Fuse 3 5.10.25 -> 5.10.26 on
Kodi 22) makes Kodi unload the skin before extracting the update, then
ReloadSkin. ReloadSkin remembers "the window that was open" - but after the
first unload there is none (WINDOW_INVALID), so the new skin loads and nothing
is activated: black screen, no input, looks frozen. kodi.log then shows only
"EXCEPTION: Window id does not exist" ~15x a second from TMDbHelper's monitor
(it asks for Window(getCurrentWindowId()) = 9999).

The GUI thread is fine, it just has no window. This thread notices an invalid
current window that lasts a few seconds and opens Home.
