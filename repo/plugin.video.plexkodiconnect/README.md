# PlexKodiConnect (PKC)
**Combine the best frontend media player Kodi with the best multimedia backend server Plex**

PKC synchronizes your media from your Plex server to the native Kodi database. Hence:
- Use virtually any other Kodi add-on
- Use any Kodi skin, completely customize Kodi's look
- Browse your media very fluently (cached artwork)
- Automatically get additional artwork (more than Plex offers)
- Use Plex features with a Kodi interface

Have a look at [some screenshots](https://github.com/croneter/PlexKodiConnect/wiki/Some-PKC-Screenshots) to see what's possible.

### Download and Installation
See here for detailed instructions: [Installation](https://github.com/croneter/PlexKodiConnect/wiki/Installation)

### Warning
Use at your own risk! This plugin assumes that you manage all your videos with Plex (and none with Kodi). You might lose data already stored in the Kodi video and music databases as this plugin directly changes them. Don't worry if you want Plex to manage all your media (like you should ;-)). 

Some people argue that PKC is 'hacky' because of the way it directly accesses the Kodi database. See [here for a more thorough discussion](https://github.com/croneter/PlexKodiConnect/wiki/Is-PKC-a-hack). 

### PKC Features

- Support for Kodi 21 Omega, Kodi 20 Nexus, Kodi 19 Matrix, Kodi 18 Leia
- Preliminary support for Kodi 22 Piers. Keep in mind that Piers is still in early alpha version - any issues you encounter are probably caused by that. Please do not use nightly versions as they tend to break stuff. To install PKC on Kodi Piers, simply use the PKC repo for Kodi Omega
- [Skip commercials/advertisements](https://support.plex.tv/articles/115003944134-removing-commercials/), [skip intros](https://support.plex.tv/articles/skip-content/) and [skip credits](https://support.plex.tv/articles/credits-detection/)

- [Plex Watch Later / Plex It!](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/sections/200211783-Plex-It-)

- Plex Companion ("PlexBMC Helper") and other stuff were adapted from @Hippojay 's great work (see https://github.com/hippojay).
- The foundation of the Plex API is all iBaa's work (https://github.com/iBaa/PlexConnect).
