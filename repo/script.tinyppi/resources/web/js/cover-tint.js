/* ===========================================================================
   The colours the poster is made of, as the surface every card is painted
   with.

   Two areas take them, and they are not painted alike.  The now-playing card
   has the poster standing in it, so it gets a broad glow in the artwork's
   representative colour, strongest beside the poster and fading gently into
   the panel.  Every other card gets that accent as a flat colour because
   there is no artwork in those to arrange anything around.  The hero stays
   the loudest thing on the page that way, and the rest of it agrees with what
   is playing without competing.

   Only the adaptive theme reads any of this; every other one ignores it and
   the card keeps the plain panel colour.  Three things decide what comes out,
   and each is a step of its own:

     where a colour is taken from  the poster is read region by region, then a
                                   representative accent is chosen from those
                                   regions (see regionalPalette/accentBase).
     how far it may be taken       the lightness is set in OKLab, which leaves
                                   the hue alone and keeps the colour from
                                   washing out on the way down (see tintColor).
     how much of it survives       the scrim is solved for this poster against
                                   the contrast the text on it needs, instead
                                   of being one fixed value for every one
                                   (see solveScrim).

   live-panels.js hands the poster over whenever the film changes; the theme
   and its strength are watched here, since either can change without it.
