   TinyPPI second-screen dashboard.

   connection itself lives in core.js.

   One page in six tabs -- live, Dolby Vision metadata, films, series and
   history, the same five in the same order as the floating bar of the
   TinyPPI app, and the settings.  Every tab is fed from the one stream whichever is in front;
   the metadata tab draws itself (js/metadata.js) and this file hands it the
   snapshot.
