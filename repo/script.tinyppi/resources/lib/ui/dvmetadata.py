"""Dolby Vision metadata view: everything the stream's side data carries.

OK on the overlay of a DV source opens a live list of every block
``script.module.sidedata`` parsed (configuration record, RPU header to L255,
static SEIs).  OK on a section opens it alone; Back goes up one level each
time.  Windows never nest: each closes before the next opens, driven by
``open_dv_metadata`` (and ``ui.overlay.open_tinyppi`` above it).

The rows come from info.dvmetadata.  This module fills and refreshes the

        47-250 ms, 72 rows 829 ms), while one ``addItems()`` with fresh
