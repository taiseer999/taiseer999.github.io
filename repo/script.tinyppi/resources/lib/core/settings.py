"""One cached settings handle per interpreter.

Each ``xbmcaddon.Addon()`` loads its own copy of the settings on first read,
which parses the whole ~100 KB ``resources/settings.xml``.  Creating a fresh
handle for every read (to see changes made mid-session) cost that load
several times a second in the dashboard, the splash and the overlay.

Kodi rewrites the stored values file whenever a setting changes, so the
handle is kept and only replaced when that file's stamp changes: one stat per
call instead of one load, and changes are still seen on the next call.

Callers can compare the returned handle with the previous one (``is not``) to
detect a settings change.
